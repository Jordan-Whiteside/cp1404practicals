# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have started to do the work way before the seminar and practical so that I can ask questions about the new topics.
I am also doing well in keeping my code fairly readable and keeping to the conventions.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Time on task: I do get distracted very easily (I just did) but I still complete the tasks given to me so maybe
I should get something to fiddle with while I'm working to keep me focused.

My attitude I think doesn't need to change as I really like this subject. Coding and problem-solving is awesome

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am doing well in the practicals so far, but I think with the introduction of classes I'll really have to focus on
naming conventions. These can sometime trick me up especially when is not obvious what it is e.g. naming the places list of lists in assignment 1.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to start assignment tasks the moment or day after they are handed out. 
This way I get enough time to ask questions about the task.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I wish every subject was as structured and thought out as this one. 
At the moment I don't have any suggestion for this subject in particular.
